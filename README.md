# Ramadan Kinder App

This Android application was made in collaboration with Pegasus Strategic Communications and Ferrero Rocher. The purpose of the app was for an event before Ramadan where a child is recorded and asked, "What good deeds would you like to do this Ramadan?" The videos are then used in a collage.<br>
The app is supposed to ask the child a few questions, including name, age, consent of recording, etc. and then save these details to an excel file. The app then connects to a GoPro Hero 13 and then the user can start the 30 second recording session.
